1# Are you working alone or with someone else? If working with someone please put their name.
    What is your plan for working on this? How much time do you plan to dedicate to working on your project? If working with a partner, how will you coordinate to work on the project?

        I plan on working by myself and I plan on dedicating 10-20 hours for my project, or however much time is needed to make sure my data is clean and I can grab a conclusion for my hypothesis.


2# What dataset are you going to use (you can select more or less anything not already used in class or homework)? 

    I plan on using a data set of moving rating from IMDB which brings in factors like runtime, genre and others and gives a movie rating for a movie. I will see how potentially a genre or a runtime may affect a rating.

3# What is your starting hypothesis about the data? Create a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis as follows

    Null: for the imbd dataset, I am predicting that based off all the data of the movie like genre and rutnntime etc, there is no corrleation between that and the rating of the movie, as it is subjective to the film.
    
    Alternative: for the imbd dataset, I am predicting that based of all the variables put together that there is a corrleation between the variables and the rating.

4# For the data I plan on doing train tests with linear regression to predict it as the final outcome I am looking at is continous data. Along with this, I also want to look at the data through KNN, as I could see what movies are have a high similarity in a category and see if there is a corrleation between them through a variable.
